- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @stuloventhal
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating an Alexa skill that accesses a website (id/pwd required) to pull some information and return it to the user
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to do this. I am looking for some example code that I can use as a basis for this effort.  Once I can get one
-       to work, then I will be adding many more.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
